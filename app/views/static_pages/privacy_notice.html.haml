      %h2.govuk-heading-m 2. Purpose of the processing and the legal basis for the processing
      %p
        The Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), which is a government
        department, is collecting data from licensing authorities in England and Wales for all
        vehicles licensed as a taxi or private hire vehicle. Under the Air Quality (Taxi and
        Private Hire Vehicles Database) (England and Wales) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019 No. 885) it
        is a legal obligation for licensing authorities to provide Defra with the following data:
      %ul.govuk-list-govuk-list--bullet
        %li
          %p Vehicle registration mark of the vehicle
        %li
          %p Date from which the vehicle’s licence has effect
        %li
          %p Date on which the vehicle’s licence is due to expire
        %li
          %p A statement as to whether the vehicle is a taxi or private hire vehicle
        %li
          %p
            Other information the licensing authority holds in relation to the vehicle that may be
            relevant for the purposes of ensuring the accurate identification of vehicles, having
            had regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State. That is:
          %ul.govuk-list-govuk-list--bullet
            %li
              %p Licence plate number
            %li
              %p An indication as to whether it is a wheelchair accessible vehicle.
      %p
        The Licensing Authorities will provide Defra with this information at least as frequently as
        once a week.
      %p
        The processing of the information (under Article 6.1 (c) of the GDPR) is for the purpose of
        ensuring that Clean Air Zone (CAZ) charging is applied correctly in adherence with the
        = succeed '.' do 
          = external_link_to('Clean Air Zone Framework',
                             'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/612592/clean-air-zone-framework.pdf',
                             id: 'caz_framework_url')
        Licensing authorities hold information on taxis and PHVs only within
        their own area so are not able to clearly identify and charge a taxi/PHV entering or moving
        around their charging CAZ which has been licensed by another authority (also known as ‘out
        of area vehicles’). If local authorities cannot identify all out of area vehicles this would
        undermine their ability to effectively operate CAZs where charging of these vehicles has
        been determined to be necessary.
      %h2.govuk-heading-m 3. Any recipient or categories of recipients of the personal data
      %p
        The Air Quality (Taxi and Private Hire Vehicles Database) (England and Wales) Regulations
        2019 (2019 SI No. 885) allow the sharing of data received with licensing authorities for the
        purposes of enforcing measures which have been implemented in an air quality plan or for the
        purposes of improving air quality.
      %p
        Defra may, under contracts or similar agreements, use third party organisations to process
        your personal data in connection with the purpose described at ‘2’ above.
        These organisations will not be able to use your data for any other purpose and will be
        required to meet the requirements of data protection legislation and government’s security
        standards.

      %h2.govuk-heading-m 4. Retention period or criteria used to determine the retention period
      %p
        Your personal data will be kept by Defra for as long as is necessary up to seven years,
        in line with the Memorandum of Understanding between Defra and licensing authorities.
